* Gender & Diversity Insights: Visualize the gender split, marital status, and employee satisfaction to foster inclusive workplace policies.
* Performance Analysis: Understand employee performance and morale with pie charts for easy interpretation.
* Location-Based Headcount Mapping: See how your workforce is distributed across states to optimize regional resource allocation.
* Department & Recruitment Source Insights: Drill down into departmental statistics and analyze recruitment effectiveness for better hiring strategies.
* Slicers for Custom Insights: Filter by department or year to uncover detailed, relevant data tailored to your needs.
*Custom Icons for KPIs: Make data more visually appealing and easier to interpret with custom icons representing different KPIs.
